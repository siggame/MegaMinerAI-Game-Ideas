# Game Design: Victory Bottlenecks

Whenever you design a game, be weary of bottlenecks that can occur in the achieving victory process. This will usually happen in games where you have to work with recources or items that gain/give victory point when worked with, but can be stolen. These can cause a single strategy to emerge that is overall harmful to the competition as a whole.

**Definition of a Victory Vottleneck:**
A bottleneck can be any point in the process of aquiring victory points that is a point of vunerability in the process where you must spend time working with it, or must keep is somewhere where it can be stolen or lost. A example of this is in the Game newtonian, the bottleneck is the refining process. After units take the raw recources and drop them in the machine, physicists must work on it to make the refined version, and then it must be placed in the generator to ad to their score. The refining is the bottleneck. A good fix for this would have been after the final phisicist works the machine the score is immediatly added. This would make it a lot less stealable and would create a simple area to defend, making that the focus for the game instead.

**Why they are bad**
Victory Bottlenecks can be a problem as it will reward AI that do nothing to actually create/achieve said recources but instead steal it all. Worse still is the fact that the units that would be used in the refining/creation process will instead be used to help steal the recources, putting the producer at a disadvantage, thus creating a single good strategy to the game that is extremely detrimental to the competition as tthere is no other good response to it.
