# MegaMinerAI-Game-Ideas

Game Ideas for each semester's MegaMinerAI

## How to use

If you are reading this, there is good news.

The good news is you are in the right place to submit and look at game ideas.

We use GitHub issues to track game ideas. It's like a forum really. If you've never used GitHub, you'll learn and it looks good on a resume.

Go to the issues here: https://github.com/siggame/MegaMinerAI-Game-Ideas/issues

There you can read all the ideas, open an issue (game idea), and you can even comment on it to help improve it.

If you have your own idea, great! Click "New Issue" and give your game a title and description. Make sure under "labels" you add the label for this semester's MegaMinerAI.
